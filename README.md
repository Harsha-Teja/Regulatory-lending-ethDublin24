# Flow of Artefact
1. Lender deposits `stablecoins / CBDC tokens` into our platform and an `NFT` is generated as receipt.
2. Borrower deposits his/her `crypto asset` as collateral to gain `stablecoins / CBDC` tokens and an `NFT` is generated as receipt.
3. `Pool` of tokens and assets is created.
4. Regulatory compliance such as `KYC, AML and CFT` is being done using `smart contracts` and `multi-chain blockchain`.
5. Borrower is given the required `loan` in the form of stablecoins / CBDC tokens on `agreed terms`.
6. Lender gets his/her deposited tokens back with some `interest` after agreed terms.
